# HaskellDES

This is an implementation of the Data Encryption Standard in Haskell. It has not
been validated by security professionals and is not guaranteed to be correct, so
it should not be used for serious encryption. Additionally, DES has been proven
broken for many years now and should not be used for serious encryption anyways.
I take no responsibility if you do not head this warning.
